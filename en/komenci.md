# introduction
As a start example, you can make a home domain system with a nano computer   _raspberry Pi3 B+_, equipping it to manage 433 MHz equipment and equipment   _zigbee_. I chose the Martiaticz Marketball software to handle the set.  

**  The   _raspberry Pi3 B+_   has for benefits:  **  

 1. Its low price  


 2. Very comfortable computer power for home automation.  


 3. reduced consumption.  


 4. No need for a fan.  


 5. Connectability provided: Ethernet Port, 4 USB ports, WiFi, Bluetooth, GPI ports.  




**  The interest of the 433 MHz is:  **  

 1. We have allowed us worldwide for decades.  


 2. As a result, there are very cheap material.  



 
His disadvantages are:  

 1. There is no defined protocol, each manufacturer does what he wants.  


 2. The protocol used is rarely bidirect.  




**  ZigBee's interest is:  **  

 1. It was designed to enable the construction of cheap modules, as a result the prices gradually fall.  


 1. It uses an open, secure and bidirectional protocol.  


 1. Each module can serve as a relay to increase the scope.  


 1. It uses a range of international frequency and to manage a large number of modules.  


 1. It was chosen by important brands such as   _Philips_   (  System   _HUE_  ), IKEA   (  System   _TRÃ…DFRI_  ), LeGrand, Xiaomi, and many more ...
