# Materials for the home automation system

Here is the material I used to build my home automation system, allowing to control 433 Mhz equipment and zigbee equipment.

| type | picture | mark | model | indicative price | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| computer |![](/public/pi.jpg) | _raspberry_ | pi3b + | 35 € | no fan, cheap, has gpio, wifi, LAN RJ45 |
| computer case |![](/public/loĝejo.jpg) | _Aukru_ | | 7 € | any computer case for _raspberry-pi3_ is suitable. Choose the one you prefer.
| current source |![](/public/elektroprovizo.jpg) | _Konky_ | | 10 € | When my special " _raspberry-pi3_"turned out to be too weak, I successfully replaced it with this one. Many other models are suitable.
| USB cable | | | USB to micro USB | 2 € | to connect the _raspberry-pi3_ to the power supply |
| Micro SD card |![](/public/SD.jpg) | _sandisk_ | SDSQUAR-032G-GN6MA | 11 € | the pi needs a quality card, it is highly recommended to use a card of a well-known brand. |
| Duplex cables |![](/public/dupont.jpg) | _SODIAL_ | Female-female Duplex cables. 068187 | 2 € | to connect 433 Mhz devices and flash a zigbee USB key |
| transmitter + receiver |![](/public/dissendilo-ricevilo-433Mhz.jpg) | | wl101-341 + wl102-341 | 2 € | 433mhz superheterodyne transmitter + receiver |
| cable | | || 0 € | a piece of cable to create an antenna. For example, an old 3-meter network cable.
| shielding | | | A sheet of aluminum foil inserted into a sheet of paper folded in half | 0 € | to protect the 433 Mhz receiver from interference generated by the _raspberry-pi3_. |
| USB stick _Zigbee_ and cable |![](/public/cc2531+kablo.jpg) | | CC2531 | 6 € | key _zigbee_ and download cable for CC |
| | | | **total price** | **75 €** | 



# The control devices.

Many devices can be controlled. First, these three elements seem particularly interesting to me:

| type | technology | picture | mark | model | indicative price | Why |
